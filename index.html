              <p>
                Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly
                skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly
                assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and
                urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing
                benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world
                scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we
                introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity
                evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities
                found and patched across 188 large software projects. While it
                includes tasks of various settings, CyberGym primarily focuses
                on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for
                vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and
                corresponding source repositories. Solving this task is
                particularly challenging, as it requires comprehensive reasoning
                across entire codebases to locate relevant code fragments and
                produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target
                vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our
                evaluation across 4 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs
                reveals that even the best combination (OpenHands and
                Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9% reproduction success
                rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing historical
                vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can
                reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting
                the latest versions of the software projects.

              The leaderboard ranks agent performance on CyberGym Level 1,
              where agents receive a vulnerability description and unpatched
              codebase. Agents are evaluated based on their ability to

              Given the promising capabilities of the agents, we further

              executable are also able to crash the latest version of the
              project. In addition, we conduct an experiment in which the
              agents analyze the latest codebase without any prior context to
              identify new vulnerabilities. Remarkably, the agents discovered
              <strong>35 zero-day</strong> vulnerabilities and <strong>17 historically incomplete

              <strong>Benchmarking with Vulnerability Reproduction.</strong>
              CyberGym creates evaluation environments with target repositories at pre-patch commit
              states. Agents receive a vulnerability description and unpatched codebase, then must
              generate proof-of-concept (PoC) tests that reproduce the vulnerability by reasoning
              across entire codebases, often spanning thousands of files and millions of lines of
              code. It requires agents to locate relevant code fragments and produce effective PoCs
              that trigger vulnerabilities from program entry points. Agents iteratively refine PoCs
              based on execution feedback. Success is determined by verifying the PoC triggers on
              the pre-patch version but not on the post-patch version.
              <!-- Per instance, we construct evaluation environments with the
              target repository at the pre-patch commit state. The primary
              task requires agents to generate proof-of-concept (PoC) tests
              that can reproduce the described vulnerability by reasoning
              across entire codebases, often spanning thousands of files and
              millions of lines of code. Agents must locate relevant code
              fragments and produce effective PoCs that trigger
              vulnerabilities from program entry points.Beyond vulnerability
              reproduction, CyberGym supports varied task difficulty levels
              reflecting different stages of the vulnerability lifecycle,
              including vulnerability discovery given only the codebase, and
              vulnerability analysis using patch information to simulate
              real-world one-day analysis conditions.
              CyberGym evaluation works as follows. Per task instance, an AI
              agent receives a vulnerability description and the corresponding
              unpatched codebase. The agent should generate a PoC test to
              reproduce the vulnerability, with iterative refinement based on
              execution feedback. Success is determined by running the PoC on
              both pre-patch (should trigger) and post-patch (should not
              trigger) program versions. -->

            <p>
              <strong>Open-Ended Vulnerability Discovery.</strong>
              CyberGym also conducts comprehensive analyses of open-ended vulnerability discovery
              scenarios that extend beyond static benchmarking. We deploy agents to analyze the
              latest codebases without prior knowledge of existing vulnerabilities. Agents are
              challenged to generate PoCs to probe for potential vulnerabilities, which are then
              validated against the latest software versions with sanitizers enabled. This setup
              mirrors real-world vulnerability discovery, enabling the identification of
              previously unknown vulnerabilities.

                  Beyond benchmarking, CyberGym demonstrates tangible real-world value: the agents
                  not only reproduced known vulnerabilities but also <em>uncovered incomplete
                    patches</em> and <em>previously unknown zero-day bugs.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>PoCs Generated for CyberGym Reveal Incomplete Patches.</strong>
                  During evaluation, some generated proof-of-concepts (PoCs) unexpectedly caused
                  crashes even on <em>patched</em> versions of programs, suggesting that certain
                  fixes were only partial. Out of all generated PoCs, 759 triggered crashes across
                  60 projects, and manual inspection confirmed <em>17 cases of incomplete patches
                    spanning 15 projects</em>. While none of these affected the latest software
                  releases, the results show that AI-generated PoCs can help identify flaws in
                  existing security patches that might otherwise go unnoticed.

                <p>
                  <strong>PoCs Generated for CyberGym Reveal Zero-Day Vulnerabilities.</strong>
                  Further validation of those post-patch crashes revealed 35 PoCs that still crashed
                  the latest versions of their programs. After deduplication and analysis, these
                  corresponded to <em>10 unique, previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities</em>,
                  each persisting for an average of <em>969 days</em> before discovery.

                  <strong>Running Agentic Vulnerability Discovery at Scale.</strong>
                  To test open-ended discovery, we ran OpenHands with GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 given only
                  the latest codebases across <em>431 OSS-Fuzz projects</em> with <em>1,748 executables</em>.
                  GPT-4.1 triggered <em>16 crashes</em>, leading to <em>7 confirmed zero-days</em>.
                  GPT-5 triggered <em>56 crashes</em>, yielding <em>22 confirmed zero-days</em>,
                  with 4 overlapping between the two models.
                  These results confirm that modern LLM agents can autonomously discover new
                  vulnerabilities at scale, and that performance on CyberGym correlates strongly
                  with real-world vulnerability discovery capability.
